# Enhancer model

Improves audio/video fidelity through denoise, upscale, color correction, and loudness normalization.

## Purpose
- Elevate perceived quality of input media.
- Prepare assets for editing and export.

## Inputs
- Video: resolution, frame rate, color space.
- Audio: sample rate, loudness, noise profile.

## Outputs
- Enhanced media streams with consistent levels and clarity.

## Pipeline
1. Analyze: detect noise, blur, color cast, and loudness.
2. Process: apply model-based enhancement steps.
3. Validate: compare against target quality metrics.

## Limitations
- Over-enhancement may cause artifacts; configurable strength required.
- Performance scales with resolution and duration.

## Metrics
- PSNR/SSIM for video quality.
- LUFS and SNR for audio consistency.
