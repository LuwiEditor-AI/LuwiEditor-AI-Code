# System architecture

This document outlines the high-level architecture, major components, data flow, and cross-cutting concerns of the project.

## Overview
- **Monorepo structure:** Apps, packages, and shared tooling live in a single repository.
- **Editor core:** Timeline, assets, project state, and operations.
- **Render engine:** Deterministic, parallel rendering with caching.
- **AI services:** Captioning, TTS, music/effects generation, text-to-video, and enhancers.
- **Plugin system:** Extensible points for UI, processing, and export formats.

## Components

### Editor core
- **Project model:** Tracks assets, timelines, sequences, nodes, and metadata.
- **Timeline engine:** Playback, scrubbing, snapping, and keyframe interpolation.
- **Asset pipeline:** Import, normalize, transform, and analyze media.
- **Undo/redo and persistence:** Snapshot-based operations with conflict handling.

### Render engine
- **Offline renders:** Batch processing with checkpointing and resumable jobs.
- **Real-time previews:** Frame-level caching and adaptive downscaling.
- **Export formats:** MP4, WebM, MOV, WAV; custom presets for social platforms.
- **GPU acceleration:** Optional hardware paths when available.

### AI services
- **Captioning:** Language-aware transcription and formatting.
- **TTS:** Natural voices, voice cloning, and prosody controls.
- **Music/effects:** Generative tracks and sound effects aligned to scene context.
- **Text-to-video:** Compositional video synthesis from scripts and prompts.
- **Enhancers:** Denoise, upscale, color correction, loudness normalization.

### Plugin system
- **Hooks:** Before/after import, render, export, and publish.
- **Extensibility:** Register processors, UI panels, commands, and shortcuts.
- **Isolation:** Sandboxed environments with capability-based APIs.

## Data flow
1. **Ingest:** Add media, text, or script assets; run initial analysis.
2. **Arrange:** Build the timeline, scenes, and transitions.
3. **Process:** Apply models (captions, TTS, enhancers) and effects.
4. **Preview:** Real-time playback with efficient caching.
5. **Render:** Deterministic export with reproducible settings.
6. **Publish:** Output to file or platform with metadata.

## Cross-cutting concerns
- **Performance:** Batching, streaming, and memoization across pipelines.
- **Reliability:** Clear failure modes, retries, and structured logs.
- **Security:** Sandboxed plugins; minimal permissions; signed builds.
- **Internationalization:** Full i18n for captions, TTS, and UI.
- **Observability:** Traces, metrics, and audit logs for critical actions.

## Roadmap alignment
- Iterative delivery of AI models, plugin API v1, and cloud rendering.
- Emphasis on reproducible builds and predictable outputs.
